Here is what I learned about using nanofibers to treat cancer:

-glioblastoma cancers are found in the brain
-they travel to different parts of the brain via nerves and blood vessels
-many times they are in places of the brain that are too risky to operate on
-the new technology that is being tested is nanofibers that the tumor can travel along to a place 
that is more easily operable or can be detroyed.
-currently it is being tested on animals
-there are no chemicals or radiation used

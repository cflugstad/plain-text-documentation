In conclusion, vertical farming has a lot of potential to produce a large amount of food. It has many

advantages over regular farming. Since it is contained indoors, it is not subject to variable weather and

temperatures. This makes it more reliable. It uses far less water than regular farming and does not

contaminate streams and natural water supplies with runoff. Another unique advantage is that vertical

farms can be created and maintained in large cities, which cuts transportation costs as well as gas use.

This system should be considered to be implemented on a larger scale.
